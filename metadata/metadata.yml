description: |-
  This capsule is designed to postprocess ephys data for the AIND pipeline.

  This capsule first removes redundant/duplicate units (sharing >90% of the spikes). Then, it computes sparse waveforms and then in computes several additional postprocessing data, including:

  - spike amplitudes
  - unit locations
  - spike locations
  - correlograms
  - ISI histograms
  - template similarity
  - template metrics
  - PCA scores

  In addition, quality metrics are also computed here. Postprocessed data are used downstream for spike sorting curation and visualization.
